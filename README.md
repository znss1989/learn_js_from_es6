# Learn JavaScript Starting from ECMAScript 6

This is a book (still work in progress...) for introduction into the programming language of JavaScript, which is being through major evolution to the ECMAScript 6 specification. While there are many resources on the topic of new features brought by the new specification, seldom talk about the language as whole when adapting these changes. This book will try to contribute as an overall intro to the novel JavaScript.
